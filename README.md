# System-Calls-and-Process-Management-with-IPC
This project involves implementing system-level C programs in Linux. It includes file copying with real-time progress, process monitoring using system calls, and inter-process communication (IPC) via pipes. The goal is to build a solid understanding of system calls, process control, and IPC mechanisms.
